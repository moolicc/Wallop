# Wallop

  * Wallop is a wallpaper engine/runtime based on the idea of "layouts" (commonly referred to as "scenes") being composed of multiple, scripted layers.
  * Wallop is crossplatform, though I'll only personally be trying it on linux and Windows 10.
  * Wallop started in 2016 as a small proof of concept and has been my off/on hobby project since.

**See the [Wiki](https://github.com/moolicc/Wallop/wiki) for usage**

## Building
Just build it from within visual studio - no fancy cake scripts anymore (the cake was thus indeed a lie).
